# Hello-World

A minimal Node.js scaffold demonstrating a tiny application with unit tests.

What you'll find here:
- A minimal `src/index.js` with a simple `greet` function
- Unit tests under `test/` using Jest
- A GitHub Actions workflow to run tests on push/PR

Quick start
-----------

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run the example script
npm start
```

Setup (one-time)
----------------

```bash
# Create any missing files and initialize the project if necessary
npm run setup

# Verifies everything: installs deps and runs tests
npm install
npm test
```
